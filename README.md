# Computer-Vision-NumberplateDetection-using-Google-cloudvision-API
Even though automatic number plate detection and recognition has already been widely tested and adopted by a lot of countries for surveillance purposes, 
But in India where the size of number plates on Indian vehicles are not fixed and the CCTV cameras which are used for surveillance purpose are not of high resolution â€” ANPR remains a challenge to be solved. 
I tried solving the detection problem using google cloud platform.
